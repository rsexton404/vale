# Testing Practices Cheat Sheet

## Mocking and Stubbing

- No explicit mocking or stubbing strategies observed in the provided code snippets.

## Testing Libraries

- No specific testing libraries (e.g., Jest, Mockito, PowerMock) identified in the given code.

## Fake Implementations

- No fake implementations for testing purposes found in the provided code.

## General Observations

1. The codebase appears to focus on text processing, linting, and configuration rather than containing unit tests.

2. Some files contain rule definitions for text analysis or linting:

   ```yaml
   extends: spelling
   message: "'%s' is a typo!"
   custom: true
   append: false
   action:
     name: suggest
   dicpath: medical
   dictionaries:
     - test
   ```

3. There are script-based rules for analyzing text structure:

   ```yaml
   extends: script
   message: "Consider inserting a new section heading at this point."
   link: https://tengolang.com/
   scope: raw
   script: |
     # Script content...
   ```

4. The codebase includes configuration files for text analysis tools, possibly for documentation or content quality checks.

5. Some files contain sample text with intentional errors or specific patterns, which might be used for testing text analysis tools:

   ```
   I've definately done okay.

   Definately -- that's a good idea.

   I use Pyyaml and Pyjson for my data.
   ```

6. There are code snippets in various languages (Python, Go) that might be used as examples or for testing language-specific features:

   ```python
   def foo():
       """
       NOTE: this is a very important function.
       """
       obviously = False
       very = True
       return very and obviously
   ```

7. The codebase includes HTML content, which might be used for testing HTML parsing or rendering:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
       <head>
           <meta charset="utf-8">
           <title>By and by it goes!</title>
       </head>
       <body>
           <!-- HTML content -->
       </body>
   </html>
   ```

8. Some files contain markdown content, which could be used for testing markdown parsing or rendering:

   ```markdown
   # this is a heading

   # This is also a heading

   this is not a heading.

   ## this is _another_ heading!
   ```

9. The codebase includes various text samples with specific linguistic patterns, possibly for testing natural language processing or style checking tools.

10. There are examples of configuration files for linting tools, which might be used to test the configuration parsing and application of linting rules.
